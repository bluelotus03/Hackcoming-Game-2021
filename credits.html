<p><strong>Kenney Game Studio</strong></p>
<p>The majority of the sprites came from <a href="https://www.kenney.nl/assets" target="_blank">Kenney's free game assets</a>.
    Some of the main sprites have been created by Ashley H. from a combination of these free assets, a few assets were
    recolored, and a couple were created by hand in Photoshop. Some of these sprites were also used to create the game
    instructions and the win/lose scenes.
