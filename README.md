## Story
##### The Holidays are almost here!
Some mischievous bunnies have taken all the presents and candy canes from the North Pole. To make matters worse, flying sun beams have broken through the ozone and threaten to melt all the ice!

## Inspiration
As lovers of Mario and 2D games, we wanted to bring a holiday theme and platformer feel to the some of the aspects of Mario. While we have designed a couple games before with other groups, we are both new to Kaboom JS. It gave us a fun chance to return to game design and learn to develop ourselves! What better way to have a **#Hackcoming?** 

## What it does
**Save the Holiday!** has some cool pretty functionality: 
* Use Santa's magic wand to reveal secret gifts or shoot snowballs
* Jump around platforms to collect candy canes and presents
* Collect icicles to grow larger and jump higher
* Avoid mischievous bunnies and flying sunbeams to reach the next level 
* Ability to play again from awesome-looking win and lose screens

## How we built it
We used various tools throughout this process: 
1. **Jitsi** was used to stay connected, discuss issues, and share our screens.
2. **GitHub** was used for version control and issue tracking.
3. **Replit** was used for development and testing gameplay.
4. **Photoshop** was used, along with Kenney free assets, to create the sprites and screens.
5. **GoDaddy** was used to obtain the domain name, and **Linode** was used to host the **Docker** containerized game.

## Challenges we ran into
Kaboom is a pretty new JS library, so it was hard to find updated documentation for various functions and how they should be used. Many tutorials were using deprecated functions or versions Replit no longer had. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
With the challenges of deprecated functions and little documentation, we were proud of how many things we were able to figure out working together and thinking through the logic. We were also happy with how much we were able to do in such a short time frame. 

## What we learned
Documentation, or no documentation, if you have the right teammate, anything is possible! We learned how to really put our minds together and get creative. 

## What's next for Save the Holiday!
Some future enhancements include: 
* Improved enemy movements
* Improved level design
* Additional levels and challenges
